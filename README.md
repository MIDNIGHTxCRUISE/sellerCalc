# sellerCalc

This is a payout tool used for FlightClub, Goat App and StockX. It shows the payout amounts per provider after inputing a number into the "Sell Price" Input field. Press the "Enter" key to submit your results and see the payouts.

I attached the JPG and PNG files for the platform pictures, be sure to download those and save to your folder to execute the picture change function.
